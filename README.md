# JM Admin

Admin template for web apps. 

### Features

* Front end only – use whatever server side language you prefer (or none).
* Styling is heavily influenced by GitHub.com.
* Made to be as fast and light-weight as possible (the full theme CSS file is around 10KB minified and gzipped).
* Uses modern CSS (e.g. variables, grid, functions, level 4 selectors).
* Easy to adjust to new projects.
* [Component-based](https://johnmodig.github.io/JM-Admin.Template/documentation/components.html) – only use what you need.
* CSS *mostly* – javascript is rarely used and only for progressive enhancement.
* Aims to use plain ubloated Html with only a few CSS classes.

### In production
